// Allowing Transference of Ownership Between Threads with Send
pub fn sync() {
    // The Send marker trait indicates that ownership of the type implementing Send can be transferred between threads. Almost every Rust type is Send, but there are some exceptions, including Rc<T>: this cannot be Send because if you cloned an Rc<T> value and tried to transfer ownership of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count at the same time. For this reason, Rc<T> is implemented for use in single-threaded situations where you donâ€™t want to pay the thread-safe performance penalty.
    //
    // Any type composed entirely of Send types is automatically marked as Send as well.

    // **** Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with Sync
    //
    // The smart pointer Mutex<T> is Sync and can be used to share access with multiple threads

    // **** Implementing Send and Sync Manually Is Unsafe
    //
    // Unsafe code. More on https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nomicon/send-and-sync.html
