    //However, because a is still referencing the Rc<List> that was in b, that Rc<List> has a count of 1 rather than 0, so the memory the Rc<List> has on the heap won’t be dropped. The memory will just sit there with a count of 1, forever.

    // **** Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an Rc<T> into a Weak<T> ****

    // Calling Rc::downgrade increases the weak_count by 1. The Rc<T> type uses weak_count to keep track of how many Weak<T> references exist, similar to strong_count. The difference is the weak_count doesn’t need to be 0 for the Rc<T> instance to be cleaned up.
    //
    // Because the value that Weak<T> references might have been dropped, to do anything with the value that a Weak<T> is pointing to, you must make sure the value still exists. Do this by calling the upgrade method on a Weak<T> instance, which will return an Option<Rc<T>>

    // **** Creating a Tree Data Structure: a Node with Child Nodes ****

However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the parent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!
